    "Since we are using the Black-Scholes closed-form solution, we do not need to use a numerical method like the binomial tree model. Therefore, we do not need to choose the number of steps for the calculation.The Black-Scholes closed-form solution is an analytical formula that allows us to calculate the price of an option without having to simulate multiple paths of the underlying asset using a numerical method like the binomial tree model. The formula provides a mathematical expression for the option price as a function of the underlying asset's price, strike price, risk-free rate, volatility, and time to maturity. In contrast, the binomial tree model involves constructing a binomial tree that represents the possible price paths of the underlying asset over time, then using backward induction to calculate the option price at each node of the tree. While the binomial tree model is a powerful tool for pricing options, it can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of time steps or complex option structures. Therefore, in cases where we have access to the Black-Scholes closed-form solution, we can use it to calculate the option price more efficiently and accurately than using a numerical method like the binomial tree model.\n"

    "The magnitude of the Delta for the call option is higher than that of the put option, which means that the call option is more sensitive to changes in the underlying asset price than the put option. This makes intuitive sense, as the payoff of the call option is increasing with the price of the underlying asset, while the payoff of the put option is decreasing with the price of the underlying asset. The signs of the Delta for both options reflect the direction of the exposure to the underlying asset price: a positive Delta means a long position, while a negative Delta means a short position. Delta proxies for the change in option price in response to changes in the underlying asset price. Obtaining a positive/negative Delta for each option makes sense because it allows traders and investors to assess the direction and magnitude of their exposure to changes in the underlying asset price. A positive Delta for a call option means that the option holder has a long position, which benefits from an increase in the underlying asset price. Similarly, a negative Delta for a put option means that the option holder has a short position, which benefits from a decrease in the underlying asset price. Delta is an important Greek for options traders and investors as it provides insight into the sensitivity of option prices to changes in the underlying asset price. The magnitude and sign of Delta for a given option can indicate the direction and magnitude of exposure to the underlying asset price, which can be used to manage risk and make informed investment decisions.\n"

On the other hand, a put option benefits from a decrease in volatility because it increases the likelihood of the underlying asset price falling below the strike price, leading to a higher payoff. Therefore, an increase in volatility will have a greater positive impact on call option prices compared to put option prices.\n"

    "Monte-Carlo methods are a popular numerical technique used to price options by simulating the underlying asset's price process. In this case, we will use Monte-Carlo methods to price ATM European options under a general Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) equation with daily time-steps in the simulations. In order to achieve reliable estimates, we will choose a large number of simulations (e.g., 100,000 simulations). We will also choose a daily time-step for the simulations. The more time-steps we use, the more accurate our estimate will be, but the longer the simulation will take to run. A convenient number of time-steps to achieve reliable estimates is 252, which corresponds to the number of trading days in a year (excluding weekends)."

    "\n",
    "To price an ATM European call and put using Monte-Carlo methods under a general Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) equation with daily time-steps, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Define the parameters:\n",
    "$S_0$: The current price of the underlying asset (e.g., stock)\n",
    "$r$: The risk-free interest rate\n",
    "$\\sigma$: The volatility of the underlying asset\n",
    "$T$: The time to maturity of the option\n",
    "For this problem, we have $S_0 = 100$, $r = 5%$, $\\sigma = 20%$, and $T = 3$ months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the daily drift and volatility: We need to convert the annualized values of $r$ and $\\sigma$ to daily values. The daily drift ($\\mu$) is given by: $\\mu = (r - \\sigma^2/2)/252$. The daily volatility ($v$) is given by: $v = \\sigma / \\sqrt{252}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate random stock prices at maturity: We need to simulate the stock price at the time of option maturity using a Monte-Carlo simulation. We can generate a large number of random stock prices by using the following equation: $S(T) = S_0 \\exp((\\mu - 0.5v^2)T + vZ\\sqrt{T})$. where $Z$ is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the payoff of the option: The payoff of an ATM European call and put option is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Call payoff = $\\max(S(T) - K, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Put payoff = $\\max(K - S(T), 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the strike price of the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the option price: To estimate the option price, we need to take the average of the payoffs and discount it back to the present using the risk-free interest rate. The option price can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Call price = $\\exp(-rT) * \\sum(Call payoff) /$ number of simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Put price = $\\exp(-rT) * \\sum(Put payoff) /$ number of simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "where the sum is taken over all the simulated stock prices and number of simulations is the total number of simulated stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing 252 steps in the tree:\n",
    "Choosing 252 steps in the tree ensures that we simulate the daily movements of the stock price accurately. This number is sufficient to capture the volatility of the underlying asset and produce reliable estimates of the option price. Moreover, it corresponds to the number of trading days in a year, which is a natural choice for daily time-steps.\n",
    "Using these formulas, we can calculate the price of an ATM (at-the-money) European call and put option as follows:"

Specifically, it represents the change in the option price for a small change in the underlying asset price. A positive Delta indicates that the option price increases as the underlying asset price increases, while a negative Delta indicates that the option price decreases as the underlying asset price increases. For an ATM European call option, the Delta is positive because the option price increases as the underlying asset price increases. This makes sense because if the stock price goes up, the call option becomes more valuable because the holder has the right to buy the stock at the lower strike price. Therefore, the call option provides a way to benefit from a potential increase in the stock price. For an ATM European put option, the Delta is negative because the option price decreases as the underlying asset price increases. This makes sense because if the stock price goes up, the put option becomes less valuable because the holder has the right to sell the stock at the higher strike price.

This is because higher volatility increases the probability of the underlying asset's price moving away from the strike price, which benefits the call option but hurts the put option.

    "From the table, we can see that the prices obtained under the two methods differ slightly for both call and put options. The percentage differences are relatively small, indicating that the results from the two methods are relatively close. However, there is a slight difference in the price obtained from the two methods for both call and put options. The Black-Scholes model is a closed-form solution and uses a number of assumptions, such as constant volatility and risk-free rate, which may not always hold in practice. On the other hand, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to price more complex options, and can handle a wider range of underlying asset dynamics and option structures. The convergence of the two methods depends on the parameters used in the models, the level of accuracy desired, and the computational resources available. In general, Monte Carlo simulation can be more accurate than the Black-Scholes model, but it requires more computational resources and is slower. The convergence of the prices obtained using different methods depends on the accuracy and efficiency of the methods used. Usually, more accurate and efficient methods will produce prices that are closer to the true value of the option, and thus these prices will converge more quickly as the number of simulations or calculations increases. In the case of the two methods used here (binomial and Monte Carlo), the prices obtained for both the call and put options are quite close to each other, with differences ranging from 0.3% to 0.6%. This suggests that both methods are fairly accurate, and that they converge relatively quickly. One reason why the prices obtained using both methods may converge is that they are both based on similar assumptions and models. Both the binomial and Monte Carlo methods are based on the same basic option pricing model, which assumes that the underlying asset price follows a stochastic process (e.g., geometric Brownian motion), and that the option price can be calculated using a discounted expected value of the option payoff. Another reason why the prices obtained using both methods may converge is that they are both based on simulations or calculations that are designed to approximate the true value of the option. As the number of simulations or calculations increases, the approximation becomes more accurate, and the prices obtained using both methods become more similar."

    "For pricing an ATM American call using Monte-Carlo methods under a general Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) equation with daily simulations, we need to choose the number of steps in the tree. Generally, the more steps we use, the more accurate our estimate will be, but the longer the simulation will take to run. A convenient number of steps to achieve reliable estimates is 252, which corresponds to the number of trading days in a year (excluding weekends). However, for American options, we need to take into account the possibility of early exercise, which can occur at any time during the option's life. Therefore, we may need to use more steps in the tree to capture the optimal exercise time accurately.\n",

In general, we may need to use more steps in the tree for American options than for European options to account for the possibility of early exercise. However, the number of steps required depends on the specific option and market conditions and may need to be determined empirically."

Based on the comparison between the GWP1 Price and GWP2 Price, we can conclude that the Monte Carlo method (GWP2) results in a slightly higher price for the Delta call option compared to the binomial method (GWP1). The %diff column in the table shows that the difference between the two prices is around 3.51%. The reason for this difference is likely due to the different assumptions and techniques used by the two pricing methods. The binomial model assumes that the underlying asset price can only move up or down in discrete steps, while the Monte Carlo method models the underlying asset price as a continuous stochastic process. The Monte Carlo method can also handle more complex payoff structures and is generally considered more accurate, but it can be computationally intensive and requires more simulations to achieve a high level of accuracy."

This is because the GWP1 Price for the Delta put option is 0, which means that the binomial method did not provide a valid price estimate for this option. One possible reason for this could be that the binomial method may not be able to handle certain complex payoff structures or pricing scenarios. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo method can handle more complex scenarios and is generally considered more accurate, but it can be computationally intensive and requires more simulations to achieve a high level of accuracy. Therefore, in this case, we can say that the Monte Carlo method (GWP2) was able to provide a valid price estimate for the Delta put option, while the binomial method (GWP1) did not.

The differences in delta for put options depend on various factors, such as the strike price, the time to expiration, and the volatility of the underlying asset. Delta is often used as a proxy for the probability that the option will expire in-the-money. For put options, a higher absolute value of delta indicates a higher probability of the option being profitable at expiration. A negative delta for a put option indicates that the option price is expected to decrease as the underlying asset price increases. This makes sense because put options profit from downward movements in the underlying asset price. As the asset price decreases, the put option becomes more valuable, which is reflected in the decreasing delta value."

This trend is expected and makes sense, as deep ITM options have a higher probability of being exercised, and therefore have a higher intrinsic value. On the other hand, deep OTM options have a lower probability of being exercised, and therefore have a lower intrinsic value. This is reflected in the option prices obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation, where the deep ITM options have the highest prices and the deep OTM options have the lowest prices. Overall, the trend in option prices as we move from deep OTM to deep ITM options is consistent with our expectations and reflects the underlying probabilities of option exercise."

    "The relationship between option prices and moneyness is different for call and put options. In particular, call options tend to decrease in price as the strike price moves further away from the current spot price, while put options tend to increase in price. This is due to the fact that the value of a call option increases as the underlying asset's price increases, while the value of a put option increases as the underlying asset's price decreases. Thus, as the strike price moves further away from the current spot price, the probability of the option ending up in-the-money decreases for call options and increases for put options, leading to the observed trends in the option prices."

    "As expected, the price of the Up-and-Out barrier option (UAO) in question 8 is much lower than the prices of the Up-and-In barrier (UAI) and vanilla options in question 9. The UAO option has a low probability of ending in-the-money due to the presence of the barrier level, so its price is significantly lower than the prices of the other two options. The price of the UAI option in question 9 is lower than the price of the vanilla option, but still relatively close. This is because the barrier level in the UAI option is not too far away from the initial stock price, and there is a reasonable chance that the stock price will cross the barrier at some point during the life of the option, allowing the option to become active and have value. However, the UAI option still has a lower probability of ending in-the-money than the vanilla option, so its price is lower. These results are consistent with the general relationship between the prices of barrier and vanilla options."
